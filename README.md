## Getting started
Add `adblocker_webview` as a [dependency](https://pub.dev/packages/adblocker_webview/install) in your pubspec.yaml file.

## Usage
1. Acquire an instance of [AdBlockerWebviewController](https://pub.dev/documentation/adblocker_webview/latest/adblocker_webview/AdBlockerWebviewController-class.html)
```dart
  final _adBlockerWebviewController = AdBlockerWebviewController.instance;
```
It's better to warm up the controller before displaying the webview. It's possible to do that by
```dart
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _adBlockerWebviewController.initialize();
    /// ... Other code here.
  }
```

2. Add the [AdBlockerWebview](https://pub.dev/documentation/adblocker_webview/latest/adblocker_webview/AdBlockerWebview-class.html) in widget tree
```dart
        AdBlockerWebview(
            url: "Valid url Here",
            adBlockerWebviewController: widget.controller,
            onProgress: (progress) {
              setState(() {
                _progress = progress;
              });
            },
            shouldBlockAds: true,
            /// Other params if required
          );
```
  Supported params of [AdBlockerWebview](https://pub.dev/documentation/adblocker_webview/latest/adblocker_webview/AdBlockerWebview-class.html]) are:
  ```dart
  const AdBlockerWebview({
      super.key,
      required this.url,
      required this.adBlockerWebviewController,
      required this.shouldBlockAds,
      this.onLoadStart,
      this.onLoadFinished,
      this.onProgress,
      this.onLoadError,
      this.onTitleChanged,
      this.options,
  });
```
